Simple http server for quick loading of content.

Installation is done via npm, which is installed along with NodeJS on most platforms.

npm -g install httpster
Then from any directory where you want to have an http service running, just run

httpster
That will start up a web server on port 3333 and let you serve up any static content you wish. If you want to change the port or directory that the server runs from pass in the -p or -d options

httpster -p 8080
